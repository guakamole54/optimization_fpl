# 🎮 Optimization Methods in Game Strategies

This repository contains the practical part of my thesis focused on applying optimization techniques to strategic decision-making in games. The goal is to explore how different optimization approaches—such as linear programming, genetic algorithms, and machine learning—can be used to solve optimization problem of a Fantasy Premier League (FPL) optimal squad selection.

Each method is implemented and demonstrated using Jupyter notebooks.

TO DOs:

- [ ] modularize the functions and only import them to the notebooks
- [ ] make the analysis of significance of the features more elaborate

# 🚀 How to Start

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/optimization-game-strategies.git
cd optimization-game-strategies
```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Open Jupyter Lab or Notebook and run the cells in order:
```
jupyter lab
```
